#The best programmer is a teacher

##Why is that?

- Because it's awesome to help people  
  And if you feel more awesome, it's very likely that you are indeed more awesome.  
- And because teaching will accelerate your own learning   
  Your student(s) will ask you things you'd otherwise take for granted. And you'll need to be able to actually explain it.  

##And the good news is that you can get started right away
It's incredibly empowering for beginners to figure out that you're not one of those people who have been hacking ever since they were a toddler and they could - just like you - learn the basics of programming in a reasonable amount of time.   

I started programming august last year. I had been working as a community manager for 5 years and being an art school graduate, I missed ‘making stuff’. The social yellow pages startup I worked for at the time allowed me to work closely together with the dev team. Not that that was all that easy. Although I was one of only 15 employees – and managing 5 of them being head of community management – the gap between marketing and communications and the developers seemed ‘unbridgeable’. As some of the attendees might know, working for a startup means you have a lot of responsibilities. A coworker that used to do some recruitment in her days might take on HR next to her day job as a marketeer and the developer who had done quite some stuff for advertising agencies is in charge of all things design. Being interested in tech topics and able to pick up on slang relatively fast (a trick that came with my job) the developers quickly adopted me as a somewhat equal in their discussions. I quickly learned how to write bug reports in a way to avoid ‘I can’t reproduce this, therefor there is no bug’.

This was around the time that our company adopted this theory of ‘constant hackweek’. As a result our developers would be working on new awesome features – that I would then eagerly translate in to normal-human-language for our blog – rather than on fixing existing bugs. Now as a community manager you’re dealing with the users of your service or product on a hourly basis. So I’d hear from my team what feature was lacking or was even throwing a huge error. As people associated me personally with the service I’d get somewhat angry direct messages urging to go and ‘talk to the engineers’. Instead of doing that however, I decided to learn Ruby (on Rails), so I could fix them myself. Or at least go as far as figuring our what the problem could be and suggest a solution.

I started with studying the Rails Girls guides and attempted to master the terminal and Git with a good friend and coworker. Having had experience with CSS, HTML and even a bit of PHP, learning Rails seemed to be not a too big of a deal. Defending why I’m [coaching at an co-organizing Rails Girls events](http://www.1stfloorgraphics.nl/rails-girls/) and not Java Girls or Go Girls (other than that it just sounds wrong) my answer would always be that Rails is fairly easy to read and understand. Which is a great first step.

In December I subscribed to this Ruby off Rails course, for I wanted to learn more about the language behind the framework. As of January I spend all my weekends in the local hackerspace rebuilding a guilt website for this online game Rift from scratch, together with another Ruby rookie, who attended DevBootcamp in SF. Our mentor is again an ex colleague of mine, who devotes his FREE time teaching two quite stubborn newbies the ins and outs of his favorite programming language.

In my adoptive hometown (Vienna) I started co-organizing WordPress meetups and Ruby meetups ([vienna.rb](http://vienna-rb.at)) to contribute to the local community of developers. It has been a very satisfying experience. I like meeting and connecting like-minded people and as far as the Ruby meetups concerned, I think it’s a healthy thing for the attendees as well, to leave their desks or attics for once and meet peers and interesting companies and get to hear some great talks about how other people deal with the recent security issues in Rails, for example.

I also have a day job by the way, I ‘do’ developer evangelism (at [Usersnap](http://usersnap.com)), translating code documentation in common people – scratch that – user-language and feature requests to dev speak.

Looking back on little-over-a-year of learning I see things that could have been tackled better. 

###Start with the basics
REALLY learning HTML, Markdown and CSS helps one to create a proper understanding of constructing decent syntax. 
Codecademy fucking rocks and so does Codeschool, so this really shouldn't be a problem. 

###JavaScript will continue to be hard (better dig into it fast)
JavaScript is just hard, the syntax is weird and complicated and it doesn't 'read' like HTML or Ruby. 
It was also hard not be fooled by CoffeeScript's popularity and end up figuring out which failing CoffeeScript line corresponded with which JavaScript line. 

###Don't get started with Bootstrap till you have a decent understanding of CSS (Inspect ALL the elements)
Being able to create a decent looking website or just know how a website is build up by looking at it, really boosts your confidence. Plus, playing around with HTML and CSS allows you to view your changes in the browser instantly, learning while you go. My mentor would let me inspect everything on a page, even if I was basically begging for the answer, after 3 hours of coding. Yes, it would upset me, but looking back it's one of the most valuable lessons I've learned. 
Notice that your student likes what he/she sees? Then it's time to dive into stuff like Less. Else, slap a bootstrap on that sucker. 

###No such thing as the perfect beginners framework. It’s a workflow thing.
The day before my [eurucamp](http://2013.eurucamp.org/) talk on the topic of this post, one of the attendees asked me what the perfect framework is for learning Rails (and Ruby). He named a few and I had only heard of one of them. Rails has great (beginner friendly) documentation, most other frameworks don't, so let's just stick to that. In the end I think it's really about teaching a good workflow (preferably test driven from the first moment on) with version control and documenting are fully integrated.

###Nobody cares about your favorite editor. Or os.
Don't expect novice coders to have an opinion on what texteditor they use. If they have already worked with the one they just opened for a while, don't start to bash their software right away (unless it's something like Smultron of course). They're comfortable with using it and that's great. They need to feel comfortable, you want them to feel confident while writing code. Don't promote Emacs/Vim/Sublime/what-have-you as the best editor ever, cause it's not. The best editor ever is whatever you are comfortable with using. 
However, if your student has never installed a texteditor before, then go ahead and introduce them to your favorite as he/she won't be confused with the different layouts when you two are pair programming.

#####"The tools that you use, are - to a large extend - incidental" - Josh Susser, panelist at Ruby Rogues

#####"Life is too short to not be happy with your editor. And it's way the hell too short to not be happy with anybody else's choice of editor."  - [Chalain](http://chalain.livejournal.com/74234.html)

###BDD rocks for beginners
During a Ruby beginners course I introduced working with cucumber and rspec and thus step definitions building your application up from the ground. Cucumber is great, because it reads like a sales pitch or a feature briefing from/to a client. Everyone that can read English can follow what you're doing there. 

###Get them to learn the lingo (to a certain extend)
I noticed that listening to RubyTapas, RubyRogues, and the likes - even though I understood fuck of what they're saying 80 percent of the time - really worked for me. I'd pause the podcast everytime I wouldn't know a certain term, look it up on Google and continue. After a while I'd need to pause a whole lot less. What I do when I have a boring task that needs to be done (like doing laundry, or whatever really), I put on a talk from a recent Ruby Conference on [confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com).  
I’d suggest subscribing to Skill Crush emails – you still have time to complete their 30-day email bootcamp before the holidays – or teaching at a beginners workshop like Rails Girls.   

###Don't let them fake it till they make it.
We WILL try and trick you into thinking we got it all figured out. Thing is, often times you'll just overwhelm us with your knowledge - and understandably so, you are after all psyched about this stuff - and if anything, that's demotivating. Rather than stopping the hands-on learning you got going on, they'll claim they know all about dependency injections. Now this requires some mind-reading, but if you have the feeling your student is fooling you, just say something like: "yeah and dependency injection in this particular case is great because ...". Else:

- Your student will feel stupid, and give up.  
- Your student will Google stuff while you're having your toilet break, and get his or her ideas from questionable sites.  
- Your student will starting putting even more evening hours in learning in an attempt to try to get to your level and will burn out as a result.   

###Know when to say: "but you can ignore this for now, we'll get back to it later"
Similar to my previous point, don't overfeed your student. Now I know how hard this is, and it requires getting to know your student and his or her level exactly. Coaching at Rails Girls workshops I often have girls in my group that vary greatly in level of experience. I found that explaining scaffolding, the MVC, how to build up a Gemfile, what gems are (see it as plugins for your WordPress blog) and generally the file structure of a Rails app are things that definitely need explaining. All else can wait. 

###Learn a different language simultaneously (in the same language)
This might sound a bit controversial, but it isn't really. I started learning Java right after I started learning Ruby. Now bear with me. I started going through a Java reader in German. I figured that working in a German speaking country, it would help learning terminology in German. It obviously didn't. First: there is simply less documentation on bugs and error messages in German. Second: Java is hard enough as it is, just stick to English already! 
Still I'd plea for learning two languages. Later I picked up on Python and it really allowed by to remember the languages' specifics by recognizing the differences and similarities in syntax. 

###Controlling everything from the Terminal makes you feel like you're in the fucking matrix
(this is a good thing)
Get your student(s) familiar with the terminal as soon as possible. As soon as I started using the terminal to create my folders even for non-programming related projects, I started using version control for basically everything and I wouldn't break my workflow anymore when I needed to test stuff or push changes. I'd be in the terminal already.  

With every Rails Girls workshop I co-organize, or coach at, I learn a little more about the ideal setup of such an event. Like: how to divide the attendees into groups in which they can really focus on learning (and have a little fun along the way). [Laura](http://www.twitter.com/alicetragedy) and I created a tutorial that teaches beginners what the terminal is capable of, for [Rails Girls Bratislava](http://www.railsgirls.com/bratislava). The [next iteration](https://github.com/FloorD/ninjanine/blob/master/tutorial.md) was already part of the intro talk at Rails Girls The Hague.

#####Did you try turning it off and on again?
Another great thing that came out of Rails Girls Bratislava, is [THE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/FloorD/ninjanine/blob/master/cheatsheet.md). Andy, Tony, Laura and I talked a lot about the errors attendees run into, that we could try to avoid - or we can help seem less scary. One way to do that of course is to add documentation to the Rails Girls tutorial, but then there's a fine line between being explicit - and cluttering the guide with information that is superfluous for many attendees.

In our cheat sheet we run through a check list. Did you save your changes? Did you restart the server? Are you working in the correct directory? Did you run ```bundle```? Did you check for typos in your code? Etc. With the bonus question being: are you using Rails 4? ;)

We encourage the attendees to take a deep breath, scroll up and read the error, Google it, and when it doubt ask their coach for help.

###Find something they can teach you
You can't believe how great it feels for your student if they can do something in return for all the hours you put in. Maybe they are good at copywriting, or design, or cooking, and they can teach you something in return. 

###Don’t use the words “it’s super easy” when it’s really not.
Developers saying that something is 'super easy' while to you it looks like the hardest thing in the world. I understand it though. It's probably the same with me telling my mum over the phone (while being in a busy tram with eager eavesdroppers) how to make something 'fat' in Word... Funny thing with my mum is that she's actually a vivid user of Twitter (follow her on @toosdreef) and Facebook. At one point I figured that explaining her how to open a link I had sent in an email was similar to crafting a new tweet on Tweetdeck. "Just select the link (she thinks clicking it will hide her email inbox forever), copy it, paste it in a new browser tab like you'd use a new tweet field, and hit enter!" Worked. 
Same goes for one of the Rails Girls The Hague coaches explaining a database as an Excel sheet. Pretty nifty.  

###Teach them to stackoverflow

##The downs

There is some nasty shit out there, waiting to hit novice coders. Fortunately you can help your student in dealing with this.

###Help them ignore the people that hate on their parade
I wish I had known I'd need to be ready for lousy jokes from brogrammers. Whenever I shared a code snippet, an excerpt of a book or a ridiculous one-pager I had made, I'd hear hurtful stuff about focussing on 'what women are good at', how much of a hipster language Ruby supposedly is or how I should stick to social media stuff as I was too lightheaded to be a developer. I couldn't really tell these people how hurtful their comments were as they'd then claim they were just joking. Maybe they were, but they were certainly not funny.   

###Imposter syndrom
If you read Ruby weekly newsletter, or lurk around on the Ruby channel on IRC, you’d assume that all open source projects are ruled by '[critical neckbeard overlords, and that submitting a bug fix or enhancement could possibly result in ego-crushing attack against your person if your code wasn’t good enough](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/62a8eaa0ea9)'. This is unfortunate as it will make you question your code. Instead, browsing issues and pull requests on GitHub, I soon realized most open source projects aren’t like that, and that most people welcome your contributions, even if it only fixes a typo.

###Frontend vs Backend
This age-old frontend vs backend discussion is everything but inviting or welcomy. Quit it. On company level (create feature teams!) and in other developer projects. Rather encourage your student or students to aim for a close to allround developer-ship and (only) then specialize in your tools of choice, be it CSS or C. Same goes for PHP bashing

###Open Source is brutal
#####"Survival of the fittest as practiced in the open source world is a pretty brutal mechanism, but it works very very well for producing quality software. Boy is it hard on newcomers though..." - Google's Chris DiBona

##The ups

Part of the solution in dealing with the ugly bits in out industry, is focussing on the good stuff. Like:   

###People rock
I wasn't quite prepared to be amazed by people putting a lot of time in making kick-ass tutorials, organizing Rails Girls events and making conferences and user group meetups as inclusive as possible. And: by you guys, who geniunly want to teach us newbies everything you know. 

###Through Ruby, I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving
Through Ruby (and programming in general), I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving, more of an understanding of folder structures and generally lost any fear to ask questions. If I couldn’t figure something out or get something to work, my mentors would encourage me to talk them through the problem. Through what I later found out is called rubber duck debugging – I often got to the root of the problem myself (often I just wasn’t in the right folder while running bundle install), without having to turn to the internet for answers.

###It's not all dorm rooms and cold pizza
GitHub provides the social component might it otherwise be absent because you're studying by yourself, in the quiet of your bed room. Introducing GitHub as a 'social network for developers' proved to work with the Rails Girls attendees.It's soothing to know there are more people out there.

##Gamify ALL the learning
There's [Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior), a 'triumphant quest of adventure, love & destiny', created by Christian Schlensker (Art Direction and Game Development), Emelyn Baker (Interface Design), Roshan Choxi (Front-End Development). Special thanks to Ryan Bates for making the original [command-line game](http://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior) that inspired this project.

And [CheckiO](http://www.checkio.org) for the pythonista's, where - in addition to coding to complete levels and earn badges and points in challenges others created - you can work on your own challenge. 
Each challenge icludes tests, documentation, and it's all hosted as repo's on GitHub, to keep it open and forkable. CheckiO at its core helps novice coders gain experience, and offer a social aspect to link novice coders with each other and more experienced programmers, by means of code reviews.   
CheckiO sponsored PyLadies Vienna and hosts hackathons.

Happy teaching!
